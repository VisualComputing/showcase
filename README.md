# Showcase Template

Welcome to the [gohugo](https://gohugo.io/) template to create rich content [academic reports](https://www.wordy.com/writers-workshop/writing-an-academic-report/) having [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) sketches.

## Hacking

Install the [gohugo](https://gohugo.io/) [static site generator](https://jamstack.org/generators/) then:

```sh
$git clone https://github.com/VisualComputing/showcase
$cd showcase
$git submodule update --init --recursive
$hugo server -D --disableFastRender
```

Deploy with `$git push` after redefined `baseURL` in `config.toml` which should point to your actual public remote.

### Remarks

1. If you renamed the repo don't forget to update all url references of the markdown and js file sources, to reflect that change. Look in all the [content folder](https://github.com/VisualComputing/showcase/tree/main/content) files for `showcase` occurrences and replace them by `<newreponame>`.
2. If you forked the repo don't forget to activate the [actions](https://github.com/VisualComputing/showcase/actions).
3. Don´t forget to select the `gh-pages` branch as the one to serve your site from at the [pages section of your repo configuration page](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site), if it is no so by default.
4. The **showcase** template uses the [hugo-book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book) theme by default. Check the [hugo themes site](https://themes.gohugo.io/) if you wish to add other ones.
