## Parallax effect
>**Prompt:** Take advantage of monocular cues to implement a 2D sketch to trick the eye into perceiving a 3D scene.

Here we have the parallax effect, tricking our eye into perceiving depth between objects in a 2-D plane.

Moon is following you at a slow speed and when the ball moves, the perspective of the buildings change.

On this sketch you can change the speed of the movement using left and right arrow keys.
